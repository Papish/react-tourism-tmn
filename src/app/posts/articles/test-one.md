The first time the two of us really questioned our environmental impact was in Nepal in 2016.

Specifically, on a bridge in Kathmandu overlooking the Bagmati River, watching aghast as a river thick with plastic, trash, and human sewage coursed its way under our feet.

We were horrified.

When we got home that night to see no less than 10 empty 1.5L water bottles lined up against the wall of our hotel room, it hit us: we were just as much a part of the problem. Needless to say, we knew then that we needed to make some pretty drastic changes to the way we travelled and lived.

Since then, we’ve become huge advocates for travelling responsibly and minimising our footprint (while still having oodles of fun!) both on the road and at home.

We’ve also been back to beautiful Nepal a number of times since — it’s our absolute favourite country in the world — and while (thankfully!) there have been huge strides made in cleaning rivers and managing waste, there are still a few responsible travel tips and things to know that all traveller to Nepal should be aware of.

From how you can empower women and respect local customs, to how to trek with care and support local business, this guide to responsible travel in Nepal is full of absolutely everything you need to travel in a way that’s ‘good for all’; ourselves, the epic landscapes, and incredibly kind, welcoming Nepali people.

# IS TREKKING IN NEPAL EVEN STILL ETHICAL?

As visitor numbers continually increase, particularly in the Everest and Annapurna regions, so too do the problems that accompany them: littering and pollution, overtourism and crowding on trails, exploitation of local porters and guides, and environmental and cultural degradation.

So is it still ethical to trek in Nepal? We believe yes.

In our opinion, trekking in Nepal boosts the local economy and raises the standard of living significantly in one of Asia’s poorest nations.

Not only should we not boycott it, we should actively be encouraging our fellow travellers to travel there. But we need to ensure that we’re encouraging them to trek in a responsible, respectful manner; one that considers their impact and works to benefit locals, the mountains, and tourists alike.

In that way, you can support Nepal’s largest industry (tourism) in a healthy way, while not partaking in its unethical side.

Here are our top tips to make that happen:
